## Overview

This repository contains a 3D pool game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game provides an immersive experience where two players take turns shooting pool balls into black pockets located in each corner of a rectangle layout. Players can control different balls using the mouse, and they have the option to pull the ball to add the right amount of strength before shooting. The game's physics engine ensures realistic ball movements, interactions between balls, pool walls, and black pockets. Balls possess various properties such as size, mass, and color, and they exhibit elastic collisions during interactions.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics:** The game incorporates an advanced physics engine, ensuring lifelike interactions between balls, walls, and pockets. Experience the thrill of a true 3D pool game!

- **Custom Game Engine:** This project includes a custom-built game engine that enhances the capabilities of the Pygame library. The engine supports various functionalities such as movement, bouncing, collision detection, and drag for the pool balls.

- **Customizable Pool Table:** The game allows users to create customizable pool tables using lines and circles. You can design unique layouts to challenge your skills!

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players control the balls using the mouse. Pulling the ball adds strength, while the direction is determined by the user's mouse movements. Master your aiming and shooting skills to become a pool champion!

- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Enjoy a competitive experience with two players taking turns to shoot balls into the pockets. The game keeps track of scores and elapsed time for each player, determining the winner based on the shortest total time to pocket the balls successfully.
